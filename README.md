**KUTAMINATOR** is a lightweight web tool to generate ready-to-send customer messages for common order issues (e.g., missing items, address errors, stock problems).

## Why this exists

This tool was built in a couple of evenings under time pressure for the 2024 Christmas campaign, when we were short-staffed. It has been used daily ever since and continues to serve its purpose well.

Our current ERP (JTL-Wawi) limits how granular and dynamic our email templates can be. KUTAMINATOR exists to bridge that gap: it provides fast, consistent message generation with simple variables and predefined options without requiring changes in JTL-Wawi.

## How it works

1. Enter the **customer name**, **order number**, and **missing item** (plus any observations).
2. Select the appropriate **issue** from radio options (e.g., out of stock, wrong address, wrong Packstation/Postnumber, etc.).
3. The app produces a **predefined, consistent message** tailored to the selection.
4. Click **Copy** and paste the result into your email client.
